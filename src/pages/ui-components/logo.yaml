title: BHP Logo
category: UI components
preText: |
  An SVG logo component that supports the BHP logo, with BHPâ€™s primary brand
  colour, and its black and white logo versions.

  The single most identifiable element of our identity is our logo. Consistent
  use of our logo is key to retaining brand strength through immediate
  recognition of who we are and what we stand for as a Company.

examples:
  - title: Primary logo
    introduction: |
      The primary logo is the first option when choosing and applying a logo.
      Our logo must be sized large enough to be easily read on every
      application.
    subTitle: Example
    react: |
      import React from 'react';
      import { BHPLogo } from 'bhp-ui';


      export default () => {
        return (
          <div>
            <BHPLogo className='mr-4' width={100} />
            <BHPLogo />
          </div>
        );
      };
  - title: Colour variants
    introduction: |
      The first preference is to use the orange logo, however sometimes to
      ensure legibility the black or white options will work better.
    subTitle: Example
    react: |
      import React from 'react';
      import { lightTheme } from 'bhp-ui';
      import { BHPLogo } from 'bhp-ui';

      export default () => {
        return (
          <div className='d-flex'>
            <BHPLogo className='m-2' />
            <BHPLogo className='m-2' color='black' />
            <BHPLogo className='m-2' color={lightTheme.grays['500']} />
            <div className='p-2 bg-primary'>
              <BHPLogo className='align-middle' color='white' />
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      };

  Any changes to our logo diminish its integrity and the equity of our brand.
  The examples shown here are some specific "do nots" for our logo.

  While minimum sizes are specified, it is preferred that the logo appears
  larger than the minimum size when possible.
