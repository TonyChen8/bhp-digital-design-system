introductionText:
  - Modal dialogues are used when you need a response from a user or to show information without losing the context of the page. No other interactions within the application can be accessed whilst a modal dialog is active. It should be used with consideration and sparingly.
  - <strong>Tip:</strong> blank out the background with an opacity overlay of 75% to make modal the most prominent element on the page.
