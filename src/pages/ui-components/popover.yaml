title: Popover
componentName: Button
introductionText:
  - Popovers are designed to give secondary content about a particular element to a page or contain further options/actions for the user in a container. The popover interaction is more efficient for small interactions because it keeps the user in the context of the action.

        <ul>

          <li>Clicking anywhere on the screen should dismiss the popover.</li>
