  Alerts are used to call the user's attention to some piece of information, such as a successful completion of a task or an internal system error. The type of alert used (success, info, warning or danger) will depend on the information in the alert. 

  **Tips**: keep the message short, use plain and simple language. Avoid tech-speak and above all never scare the users. Don’t state the obvious (like "an error has occured") and never assume the users know what you are talking about. Keep it in-brand and use language consistently. The best alerts messages are short, positive and plain.
