Developers and designers who have been tasked with creating digital tools at BHP will have a common reference library to speed up the ideation process and ensure a common look and feel across all of BHP\'s digital assets.</p>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>By centralising all the most commonly used component parts, designers and developers can concentrate on making functionality that will improve their project without having to re-design the same components over and over.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="col-md">\n<h4>Scope</h4>\n<p>All custom built software projects across BHP will find the Digital Design System useful.  This version of the application had contributions across teams throughout technology and other parts of the business.</p>\n<h4>How?</h4>\n<p>You can use this library in many ways.  Designers can access the guidance on re-using components that are compliant with the BHP Brand Guidelines whilst developers have access to the pre-built components that they can simply and quickly integrate into their project.</p>\n<p>The Digital Design System has been developed in line with the Bootstrap framework so that it can easily be used on all digital projects across BHP.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class="hero-tertiary">\n<div class="container">\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col-md">\n<h4><span class="text-bhp-orange-1">Be contextual</span></h4>\n<p>Understand the context of the situation that the person is in, and therefore how they may think, perceive information or perform tasks different under those circumstances. Support the user to achieve their goal and accomplish their tasks by presenting them with the information and options where and when it counts (i.e. at the point of need).</p>\n<h4><span class="text-bhp-orange-1">Be human</span></h4>\n<p>Understand that we are designing for humans, which requires taking into consideration that mistakes will be made, that people want to be in control, want things to work (the first time) the way they think it will (or should). However, this also means that they will be understanding if you can show an honest attempt to help them solve their problems. Overall, this means that we should aim to make the interface and content look and feel like an interaction with a human, not a machine.</p>\n<h4><span class="text-bhp-orange-1">Be easy</span></h4>\n<p>The level of usability should be such that it requires no special expertise or domain knowledge when it comes to common or basic features. Special or customized functionalities should be just complex enough to ensure the task can be completed successfully without spending time on working out how to perform the task.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="col-md">\n<h4><span class="text-bhp-orange-1">Be findable</span></h4>\n<p>By creating a consistent user interface we can provide a layer of logic for users to learn and remember where to go, what to see and what actions they need to perform. Making things findable also means that it should tailor for beginners with no prior experience that need to be able to pick things up quickly, and for experienced users to become proficient if they are being asked to change from an existing application which they are familiar with to a new application.</p>\n<h4><span class="text-bhp-orange-1">Be simple</span></h4>\n<p>The number of different views should be kept to a minimum. The level of content density should be appropriate for the task at hand. The amount of choices should be limited so that the decisions that they have to make are not overwhelming or hidden.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class="hero-quaternary">\n<div class="container">\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col-md">\n<h3><span class="text-bhp-orange-1"><i class="material-icons">mode_edit</i> For Designers</span></h3>\n<h5>Consistency</h5>\n<p>Experiences are familiar and act as expected.</p>\n<h5>Performance</h5>\n<p>Tasks are completed as accurately and as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h5>Craftmanship</h5>\n<p>Engage emotion through delightful, considered experiences.</p>\n<h5>User first</h5>\n<p>The experience should adapt based on needs.</p>\n<h5>Helpful</h5>\n<p>Continual support through guidance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="col-md">\n<h3><span class="text-bhp-orange-1"><i class="material-icons md-36 md-top">settings_ethernet</i> For Developers</span></h3>\n<h5>Consistency</h5>\n<p>Ensure your work is sustainable and flexible.</p>\n<h5>Performance</h5>\n<p>Be content-agnostic, develop for generic use first.</p>\n<h5>Craftmanship</h5>\n<p>Reuse as much as possible: technologies and components.</p>\n<h5>User first</h5>\n<p>Keep it simple.</p>\n<h5>Helpful</h5>\n<p>Leave code in a better state than you found it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>',fields:{slug:"/"},frontmatter:{title:"Design Principles",category:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/"}}}});
